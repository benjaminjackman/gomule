#+STARTUP: overview

gomule bugs and feature request
* gomule should not allow put item in the cube if there is no cube in the :high:
  user's inventory or stash.

  currently if a charater doesn't have a cube and you put something there,
  they will appear in gomule next time you open it in gomule.

  I don't know what will happen if you pick up a cube in N Act2, save the
  game, then open it in gomule.

  GoMule should gray out the cube section, if the user still try to move item
  there, display a message tell the user there is no cube on the char, so the
  move is not possible.

* DONE MAX gold in Stash should be at 2,500,000 from lv 1	   :bug:easy:
  when transfer money using the gomule bank.

  I have a lv 55 necromancer, has max gold, and can't deposite in gomule bank
  because gomule doesn't want max gold to be more than 1,400,000 at that
  level.
* DONE gomule should preserve Skill Tab				:bug:wontfix:
  currently after muling in gomule and go to game, press T, you will always at
  the 3rd tab.
  skill tree tab should be what the user choose when they left game last time.
** I can't reproduce it now on a necromancer.
* DONE gomule should keep oskill on switch weapon		:bug:wontfix:
** how to reproduce the problem?
   a sorc has a lower resist wand on 2nd weapon slot, and lower resist skill
   on right click.
   the sorc switch to main weapon.
   quit game.
   mule using gomule and save.
   load char in d2, press W to switch to 2nd weapon, now the skill on right
   click is not lower resist.
** what should it be?
   the skill (even oskill) on right click should preserve as long as the item
   providing the skill is not moved off the char in gomule.


*** Again. Can't reproduce it on necromancer.
    has a staff with teleport charge on off-hand weapon.
    main weapon RMB skill: Amp
    switch RMB skill: teleport
    quit game.
    mule in gomule.
    open char in game. still Amp & tele on RMB skill. no problem.
* feature request: close all window (auto-save)
  just like click on menu Project->Preferences then close.
* feature request: allow custom sorting of stashes/chars
* feature request: support multiple level of directories
  so I can have:
