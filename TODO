#+STARTUP: overview

gomule bugs and feature request
* 
* feature: mule MAX gold to char
  add a button in "Transfer" section:
  [to char] MAX Gold [from char]

  click [to char] will fill char with max possible gold.
  click [from char] will deposite all Gold in char to gomule bank.
* refine GUI for stashes

  TODO what does the two "Other" mean in current GUI?

  group:
  class: []Normal []Exceptional []Elite []Other []All
  feature: if none of normal, exceptional, elite, other is selected, auto select All.
  eth: [] Ethereal
  quality: []Uniq []Set []Runeword []Rare []Magic []Craft
  socketed: []1 sock []2 sock ... []All
  weapon sub section should sort with dictionary order.
  change weapon types according to the AS:
  Knife -> Daggers
  Hand to Hand -> Assassin Katars
  put class specific type at last, group them together.
* feature: add essense in "Misc" section
* feature: auto grab and sort for common items. 		:low:feature:
  detect common items from current character, grab them and place them into
  pre-defined stashes.

  This is like the filter in email client.
  user can define rules, gomule will filter items and place items according to
  the rules.

** my rules as example:
   // gems
   in [default area], select [gems, flawless gems], drop to [sc_todo].
   in [default area], select [perfect gems], drop to [sc_craft].
   in [default area], select [chipped diamond], drop to [sc_lesser].
   // runes
   in [default area], select [runes El-Thul], drop to [sc_lesser].
   in [default area], select [runes Amn-Hel], drop to [sc_begin].
   in [default area], select [runes Io-Gul], drop to [sc_main].
   in [default area], select [runes Vex-Zod], drop to [sc_godly].
   // grey socketed item
   in [], select [grey item], drop to [sc_rw].
   // essense drop to sc_essense

   default area is defined in options page and can be changed by user.
   my settings for default area:
   first 4 columns of inventory space.
   all stash space except last grid on the bottom right.
** UI
   add a button in toolbar: 'auto drop'
   the auto drop window:

   character: CHAR_NAME
   rules:
   | rule1 |     run select rule
   | rule2 |     run all
   | rule3 |
   | rule4 |

* TODO gomule should not allow put item in the cube if there is no cube in the :high:
  user's inventory or stash.

  currently if a charater doesn't have a cube and you put something there,
  they will appear in gomule next time you open it in gomule.

  I don't know what will happen if you pick up a cube in N Act2, save the
  game, then open it in gomule.

  GoMule should gray out the cube section, if the user still try to move item
  there, display a message tell the user there is no cube on the char, so the
  move is not possible.
* resistance calculation is wrong.					:bug:
  I notice resistance in game is way different from what's shown in gomule.
  even 50% differ.

  edit: sometimes it is wrong. not sure when.
  the base code really need a review.

  edit: when you close and reload a char, the resistances are right, but after
  you mule some items in and out, the resistances are wrong.

* DONE MAX gold in Stash should be at 2,500,000 from lv 1	   :bug:easy:
  when transfer money using the gomule bank.

  I have a lv 55 necromancer, has max gold, and can't deposite in gomule bank
  because gomule doesn't want max gold to be more than 1,400,000 at that
  level.
* DONE gomule should preserve Skill Tab				:bug:wontfix:
  currently after muling in gomule and go to game, press T, you will always at
  the 3rd tab.
  skill tree tab should be what the user choose when they left game last time.
** I can't reproduce it now on a necromancer.
* DONE gomule should keep oskill on switch weapon		:bug:wontfix:
** how to reproduce the problem?
   a sorc has a lower resist wand on 2nd weapon slot, and lower resist skill
   on right click.
   the sorc switch to main weapon.
   quit game.
   mule using gomule and save.
   load char in d2, press W to switch to 2nd weapon, now the skill on right
   click is not lower resist.
** what should it be?
   the skill (even oskill) on right click should preserve as long as the item
   providing the skill is not moved off the char in gomule.


*** Again. Can't reproduce it on necromancer.
    has a staff with teleport charge on off-hand weapon.
    main weapon RMB skill: Amp
    switch RMB skill: teleport
    quit game.
    mule in gomule.
    open char in game. still Amp & tele on RMB skill. no problem.
* feature request: close all window (auto-save)			       :easy:
  Add a "Close All Window" button on toolbar.

  just like click on menu Project->Preferences then close.
* feature request: allow ordering of stashes/chars
  the default is sort by alphabetic, while the user may not want that.
* feature request: support multiple level of directories
  so I can have:
  Project: GoMule
  D2
  characters
      current
	  SHERO
      suspend
      dead
  stashes
      Charms
	  Life
	  Life_Mana
	  AR
	  AR_DAM
	  Resistance
      Gems
	  chipped
	  todo
	  Perfect
      Class
	  ama
	  sor
	  dru
	  nec
	  asn
	  bar
	  pal
** the tree status(expand/collapse) will be preserved between gomule sessions.
